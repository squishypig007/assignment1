      <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>

      <div class="intro-container">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        When we look at the world around us, we often don't realize that each object/machine/set-up is an interface that was specifically designed to suit our needs
        and intentionally built with specific users in mind. 
        <br> Each interface prompts certain behavior and a story follows...
        <br>
        Thinking about the ways in which we interact with the world around us led me to pay more attention to interfaces I use everyday. It got me wondering whether
        they were built for me and who else they could've been built for. 
        <br>
        One such interface that caught my attention was that of the parking meter. The variation in the design of this interface as I have witnessed across locations, 
        with a variety of controls led me to look into its nuances further.
      </div>

      <div class="observations-container">
        <h2>My Approach: the Parking Meter Interface</h2>
        <p>The parking meter on Thayer Street was one that particularly caught my attention. It is an interface used to buy tickets to park in designated spots
          on the street during specific hours of the days mentioned as per city policy. The interface solves this problem in a self-serving manner 
          (without a ticket collector needing to be present).
        <br>
        <br>
          The interface include 2 navigation arrows to "scroll" through options of payment (coins and card), coin/card slots, a confirmation button marked by a
          tick, a cancel button marked by a cross, a home screen with general information including date/time/parking policy, a payment screen and a slot to collect the ticket.
        <br>
        <br>
          The key components are annotated in the first diagram with a zoomed in version of the home screen in the next section. The user is meant to read the policy on the home screen,
           input money into the designated slots, navigate to the time limit they desire, confirm the payment and receive the ticket from the designated slot. 
           <br>
           <br>
           I wanted to explore the different ways in which other people might experience this interface so I sat by the corner of a parking meter on Thayer Street and observed/interacted with the 
           first 3 users that came by.

        <h2>Interactions and Observations</h2>
        <div id="patterns">
            <h3> Patterns and Key Observations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>	The 3 users (say User 1, User 2, User 3) were a middle-aged man, a woman in her 20s, and a man in his 20s respectively. </li>
              <li>	Out of three of the users, User 1 and User 2 used coins for payment straight; User 1 had five quarters ready in-hand before approaching the parking meter. </li>
              <li>	User 2 restarted the transaction midway, consecutively pressing the cancel button a few times</li>
              <li>	User 3 tried to use a card and was interacting with his phone on the designated PVD311 App for 2-3 minutes. He was the only one who scanned the barcode on the meter. </li>
              <li>Only User 3 stopped to read the home screen before proceeding with the transaction. </li>
              <li>	None of the users seemed to interact much with the arrow buttons nor attempted to touch the lower screen as pictured below.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
          
          <p> The following was the home screen as seen by the users while in use. The instructions rotated, displaying the policy as mentioned in the previous section.</p>

        <div class="observations">
          <h3> Questions and Summarized Answers</h3>

            <h4>(1) How long did you expect your interaction with the parking meter to take? How long did your interaction last?</h4>
            <li>All three users estimated a similar time range they expected to spend on the interaction which was that of 2-3 minutes. </li>
            <li>User 1 and 2 reported they spent about as much time or a little more than they'd expected; User 3 reported to have spent about 10 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <h4>(2) Have you used a parking meter before? If yes, how did this parking meter compare to those you've used before?</h4>
            <li>All three users had used parking meters before, which was expected. </li>
            <li>User 1 and 2 reported they spent about as much time or a little more than they'd expected; User 3 reported to have spent about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> User 1 reported that they often used parking meters of the same kind as he lived in the area and most of the meters in that location  had the same interface.</li>
            <li> User 2 and 3 reported that the parking meters they had interacted with before were similar but more digitally advanced with better graphics on the screens and better 
              accommodations for credit cards. </li>
            <br>
            <h4>(3) Which features (if any) of the interface were helpful and which features (if any) were challenging to users?</h4>
            <li>All 3 Users reported that the arrows pointing to the coin and card slots as well as the shape of both the slots was helpful and intuitive.</li>
            <li> They also said that the Home screen had clear instructions about the amount to be paid and time limit and that displaying the current time was 
              useful</li>
            <li>All 3 users found the arrow navigation buttons to be either useless or confusing to use. User 2 felt that having screens that did not respond
              to touch, with only 4 interactive buttons was slightly challenging.
            </li>
            <li>User 3 felt that the instructions to use the credit card were very convoluted and that the barcode was difficult to scan due to the blurry print. 
              He also reported that the blinking red light was distracting and seemed purposeless.
            </li>
            <br>
            <h4>(4) How would you rate your overall experience from 1-10 (10 being the best)? Do you think the interface was effective?</h4>
            <li>User 1 was happy with the experience and rated the interface a 9. He said that it is overall straightforward but his poor vision does not allow him to read
              the screen. He says he leaves the house everyday with exactly 15 quarters to last the workday.
            </li>
            <li>User 2 was somewhat happy with the experience and rated the interface a 7. She felt the interface was effective but that such an ordinary task 
              shouldn't need to be re-learnt each time due to variation in interface.
            </li>
            <li>User 3 was unhappy with his interaction with the interface but still gave his experience a 5 out of 10 as he felt that the interface did have the tools
              to make completely the task required. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <h4>(5) How could the experience be improved to better tend to your needs?</h4>
            <li> Users 2 and 3 felt that regularly maintaining the meters and improving the graphics on the screens would help a lot </li>
            <li> User 3 felt that having clearer instructions for the credit card payment method would've helped people like him who don't have the time to download and 
              follow along on a mobile app.
            </li>
            <li>User 1 considered that having to carry exact change was actually quite inconvenient for him. He also wished there was a way to 
              tally the amount he inputted as the display responsible for this was too dark, requiring him to count the coins.
            </li>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <br>
        <p>From the above interactions and observations, I was able to create two personas that I thought encapsulated the problems that the users had with the interface.
          These two personas are College-kid Cam and Meticulous Melissa.</p>
        <div id="cam_user">
          <h3>College-kid Cam Brown</h3>
          <h4>Cam, a college-kid, just moved off-campus; he drives to campus daily. 
            Today Cam is running late for his 8am and is struggling to understand how to use his credit card as he doesn't carry much cash/coins.</h4>
            <img id="cam" src="./Cam Brown_1.jpg" alt="Persona of Cam the college kid">
          <ul>
            <li>
              This persona is unable to scan the barcode for the credit card payment and finds it difficult to follow along the lengthy instructions regarding
              the app needed for this mode of payment.
            </li>
            <li>Like most on the college-going kids on Thayer, Cam does not carry cash or coins and is struggling to find change for the machine, due to its poor
              support/instructions for credit cards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cam struggles to use the screen to get better instructions as they are not touch sensitive nor do they have more than 4 controls, most of which 
              he finds unhelpful.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cam represents a fair majority of the users interacting with the parking meters on Thayer as it is in the center of the college campus, 
              next to most of the academic buildings.
            </li>  
            <li>
              Cam is always running to some place or the other and hopes for transactions to be as simple as a tap of a credit card, as most places have support in
              present day
            </li>   
            <li>
              Cam is inpired by my interactions with and observations of Users 3 and 2 in their struggle to use the credit card mode of payment and navigate the controls respectively
            </li>             
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="melissa_user">
          <h3>Meticiulous Melissa Smith</h3>
          <h4>Melissa, a middle-aged woman, collects exact change and counts the coins as she inserts them.
            After sunset, she's tired from work and cannot tell if she dropped a coin or inserted it as the display can't be seen. </h4>
        <img id="melissa" src="./meticulous Melissa_1.jpg" alt="Persona of Melissa and the quaraters">
        <ul>
            <li>
              This persona is forced to be overly meticuluous with the number of quarters she carries as the display showing the amount inserted is grainy and dark.
            </li>
            <li>Melissa's to-do list has 2 extra tedious items of carrying/collecting quarters due to the lack of credit card support and carrying around 
              reading glasses for the display.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a long day of work, she's faced with another task of remembering ot count the exact number of quarters she inputs into the machine and has to be extra
              careful not to drop any as she would have no way of knowing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Melissa is like many middle-aged professors and residents that live in the area who are probably in the same age range and have poor vision as a result. She is 
              also like maky parents of college-kids who park on Thayer when visiting.
            </li>  
            <li>
              Cam is always running to some place or the other and hopes for transactions to be as simple as a tap of a credit card, as most places have support in
              present day
            </li>

          </ul>

      <div class="intro-container">
        <h2>Storyboard</h2>
        <p>Here, I explore the authentic experience of one of the personas mentioned above in the form of a storyboard. The persona I'm focusing on is that of Meticulous Melissa. 
          <br>
          She pre-empts the parking and paying process and keeps her reading glasses and exact change ready so as to compensate for the lack of support the parking meter has.
          She squints to see if the correct number of coins are inputted as the brightness of the second screen is low and finally proceeds home after a long day of work.
